A Monorepo containing the "reviewer" project packages

Reviewer is a web application where users can register and post Products, and ask for a review from other users who happen to have these products.
A review can have a rating of 0 to 10 and can be followed by a comment from the user reviewing.
Users can also link a reference to a e-commerce so people can see more details from their product.
