## NodeJS All-in-one boilerplate

This repository constains a basic NodeJS project configured with:

- Typescript
- .env example setup
- Prettier
- Jest Testing Framework (with a semple test)

After you clone this repo you should run `npm install` / `yarn install`

And after that you can run the following scripts:

- start:dev -> runs the project with nodemon
- start:prod -> runs the build files from the dist folder
- build -> builds the project for production
- test -> runs all the tests once
- test:watch -> runs the testing in watch mode
- test:coverage -> runs the tests, followed by coverage and outputs a coverage folder

This is the Basic config that i'll be using from now on all my NodeJS Backend / CLI projects.
